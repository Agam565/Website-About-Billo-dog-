     <b>Hi Hooomaannz, my name is Billo and I was born on a farm on March 23,2021. 
     I am a golden-doodle which is a combinaton of a Golden Retriever and Poodle. My dog mom's name is Sophie and dog dad's name is Preston. 
     My new  hooomaann parents are generous, loyal and wealthy but at the same time, very crazy. My new dad loves me so much and pampers me with toys and delicious food while my mom loves to lock me in my kennel 24/7(her favourite hobby).
   <br>
     I have a sister who can be <mark-weird>weird</mark-weird> at times -<b><i>correction</i></b>- all the time. Like the other day, she made me lick her feet which is apparently something humans despise but she doesn't. <mark-bizzare>Bizzare.</mark-bizzare> However, that is one of my favourite things to do.
    Lastly, I have a brother who is my <mark-personalassistant>personal assistant</mark-personalassistant> and does everything from taking me outside every 2 hours to do my bathroom business to giving me treats and my kibble. Every year, he comes for a month and has to do work for me and in return gets to have free food and sleep in an air-conditioned house.
